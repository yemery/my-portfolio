        In the summer of 2021, after <span className="font-semibold">obtaining a high school degree in science
        and mathematics</span>, I found myself at a crossroads, unsure of my next
        steps. A close person who inspired me and introduced me to the world of
        programming languages and crafting digital solutions.
      </span>

      <span className="max-w-[900px] ">
        Eager to explore this new interest, I embarked on a self-guided journey,
        utilizing online resources and YouTube tutorials to delve into the
        basics of algorithms and the Python language. As I absorbed basic
        knowledge, I translated theory into practice, building small projects.

        Realizing I wanted to dive deeper, I seized an opportunity to enroll at
        the <span className="font-semibold">Institut Spécialisé de Technologie Appliquée NTIC Rabat</span> in October
        2021 as a <span className="font-semibold"> specialized technician in full-stack web development</span>. Over two
        years, I created websites, scripts, and bots. Before graduating, in my
        last year, I interned at Company <span className="font-semibold">Al omrane rabat</span>.

        During the <span className="font-semibold">internship as a web developer</span>, I led the development of a <span className="font-semibold">web
        app to streamline material management</span>. I improved user roles, focusing
        on admin tasks such as order handling, stock management, data
        visualization, and more. Agency directors and employees benefited from
        enhanced workflows, including order validation and product monitoring.
        My role also involved <span className="font-semibold">cleaning data</span> and <span className="font-semibold">filling database </span> tables using
        <span className="font-semibold"> pandas scripts and Selenium</span>.
      </span>

        After graduating in July 2023, I enrolled in the <span className="font-semibold">École Marocaine des
        Sciences de l&apos;Ingénieur in Rabat</span> in October 2023, starting a new
        chapter as a <span className="font-semibold"> software engineering student</span>.
